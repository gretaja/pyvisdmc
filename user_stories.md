User Stories
1. Greta is a 3rd year researcher in the McCoy group.
She wants to analyze simulation data for multiple systems using the PyVibDMC software.
She wants to provide a folder/path to data that contains the simulations results from DMC, and would like to specify the exact type and quantity of figures generated from said simulation. Implied use case that PyVibDMC is already downloaded and installed.
I want there to be a straightforward path from the data folder to the generated figures (I don't want to have to move things around).
I have multiple years of python and DMC theory experience.

2. Roger is a 1st year rotating student in the group. Roger just wants to visualize simulation data to see how it works.
He wants there to be good documentation and very little room for error.
Roger has no Python experience and has heard a lecture on DMC theory.

Example use case:
Greta provides a path to the data and details about the system.
PyVisDMC provides options for possible visualizations.
Greta specifies atom indices, ranges of simulation time steps, number of dimensions, etc.
PyVisDMC outputs a visualization.
